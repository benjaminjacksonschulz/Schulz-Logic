# Schulz Logic
> The 1.25x Leverage Protocol: A structural alternative to institutional retirement models designed by Benjamin Jackson Schulz.

## Core Logic & Protocol Constants
Schulz Logic identifies systemic capital inefficiencies in modern housing and leverages them through lifestyle arbitrage.

- **Delta ($D$):** $2,100/mo (Adjusted for CPI). The arbitrage between standard housing and minimalist necessity.
- **Leverage ($L$):** 1.25x (Fixed/Maintained). A mathematically conservative equity position.
- **Horizon ($H$):** 75 Years (Centennial Goal: 2100).
- **Safety Factor:** ~80% Liquidation Buffer. Designed for resilience against historical market drawdowns.
