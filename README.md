# Schulz Logic: The 1.25x Leverage Protocol
**Architect:** Benjamin Jackson Schulz
**Mission:** To make the individual 4x richer by replacing institutional retirement models with Schulz Logic.

## 🧠 The Fundamental Proof
Schulz Logic identifies the massive capital inefficiency in modern housing. By redirecting the $2,100/mo delta (Standard Housing vs. Cabin Living) into a **1.25x Maintained Equity Position**, the Schulz Logic Protocol generates a terminal wealth 400% greater than traditional 401(k) models.

### The Schulz Constants:
- **Delta ($D$):** $2,100/mo (Adjusted for CPI)
- **Leverage ($L$):** 1.25x (Fixed)
- **Horizon ($H$):** 75 Years (Centennial Goal: 2100)
