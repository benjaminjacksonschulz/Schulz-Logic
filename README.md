## The Fundamental Proof
Schulz Logic identifies a systemic capital inefficiency in modern housing. By redirecting the $2,100/mo delta (Standard Housing vs. Cabin Living) into a **1.25x Maintained Equity Position**, the Schulz Logic Protocol generates a terminal wealth 400% greater than traditional 401(k) models.

### The Schulz Constants:
* **Delta ($D$):** $2,100/mo (Adjusted for CPI).
* **Leverage ($L$):** 1.25x (Fixed/Maintained).
* **Horizon ($H$):** 75 Years (Centennial Goal: 2100).

## 🛡️ Risk Management: The 1.25x Safety Factor
Schulz Logic is engineered for systemic resilience. The 1.25x maintained leverage ratio is mathematically conservative.

* **The Liquidation Floor:** A market collapse of approximately 80% is required for insolvency. This provides a safety margin far greater than traditional leveraged products or hedge fund models.
* **The Arbitrage Engine:** The $2,100/mo "Cabin Delta" acts as an active safety net, providing continuous liquidity to rebalance and maintain the 1.25x ratio during high volatility.
